Get input and output arguments from the command line

If irobot URL and arvados token are supplied at command line
    Get URL and token
Else
   Get values from environement varibales

Check that the CRAM and CRAI files exist at the /location/of/the/input/file
    If not
        Exit request and print error to user (stacktrace to log file?)


    Check that whether the output file exists
        If it does, ask the user if they want to overwrite it?
            If the user doesn't
                Ask the user for a new name or append a number to the end of the filename
            Check if the new name exists
        If the user does

Send HTTP request for CRAM file
    Listen for response
    Handle response
        If wait code
            Wait and then pole again (send a new request??)
        If duplicate MD5Sum
            Tell the user then exist

        If duplicate MD5Sum
            Tell the user then exist
        If error code
            Tell user and exit (log error?)
        If download complete
